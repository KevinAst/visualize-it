# core modules

The **core modules** represent the **visualize-it** run-time
environment needed to visualize and animate views in an external app.

As such, these modules are packaged and published separately as a
run-time library.  TODO: this may not be correct, depending on what we
decide to do in regard to simply promoting run-time models with app in
an iframe :-)
